# bot
Info:
- Max values for jump at 1080p:
```
	jump(960+720, 540) ;left/right jump close to max range
	jump(960, 540-370) ;up/down jump close to max range
	jump(960+562, 540-260) ;diagonal jump ABSOLUTE max
```

- jumping fast = disconnect
- jumping to exactly the same spots = ban in jail

- This random jump put acc into bot jail: 
@Edit - spamming any action in short period of time put character to jail
@Edit - jumping very slow in random period of times with randomized location also puts character to jail

```

- TODO difference beetwen mode 0 and 2 in this mode:
```
MouseCoordMode 	Sets the way coords are used in the mouse functions, either absolute coords or coords relative to the current active window:
0 = relative coords to the active window
1 = (default) absolute screen coordinates
2 = relative coords to the client area of the active window
```
